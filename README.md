## 🤔 What is this repo?

This repository contains the source code for Dev Sanx's stylish website. The site is written using [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) and [C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/languages/csharp) using ASP.NET, and deployed on both Oracle Server (by me, [@Lamparter](https://github.com/Lamparter)) and on Raspberry Pi (courtesy of [@FireCube](https://github.com/firecubestudios)).

This repo also contains various bots written in Python and C# (and perhaps also Node in the future) that are built using Developer Sanctuary's distributed bot model.
